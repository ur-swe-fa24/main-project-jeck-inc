### Who prefers what? ###’
## Chris ## 
- I prefer to work on the database and the frontend. However I am comfortable working on any part of the project. 

## Kritim ## 
I can work on the back end, specifically assignment of tasks, logging of robot and other states, and validating pre and post-conditions between switches of different interfaces. I would also like to contribute to the database. That would require me to learn MongoDB. I plan to do so in the process. I am also flexible with any other roles that require consideration.  

## Eric ##
I would enjoy working on the simulation engine. Also have experience from Human-Computer Interaction on designing user interfaces so would work on that. System manager back-end code and database are interesting to me as well. 

## Jack ##
I’m pretty open to working on any part of the project. I’m specifically interested in working with Mongo DB as well as helping out with the front-end.
