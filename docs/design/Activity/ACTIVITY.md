# Activity Diagrams

## Robot Database Simulation Activity Diagram
This activity diagram describes the process of interacting with a robot, simulation, and database system. It showcases how users can add robots with specific sizes and functions to the system and then store and process these robots within the simulation and database.

## Key Steps in the Diagram:
+ Start of the Process:


+ User Presses Add Button:

   - The user initiates an action by pressing the Add Button.
   - The system proceeds to get the size and type for the robot from the GUI.
   - The robot is created based on the size and type selected by the user.
   - The newly created robot is added to the system.
   - A confirmation message is displayed, indicating that the robot has been successfully added to the system.

+ User Presses Fix Button:

   - The user presses the Fix Button.
   - The system gathers data (Robot ID) from GUI  to identify which robot they want to fix.
   - The system checks the robot's status based on the ID:
   - If the ID is invalid, a message is displayed saying that the robot ID is invalid.
   - If the ID is faulty, a message is shown indicating that the robot is faulty.
   - Otherwise, the robot's ID is marked as fixed, and a corresponding message is displayed.


+ User Presses Show All Robots Button:

   - The user presses the Show All Robots Button.
   - The system retrieves and displays all the robot IDs currently stored in the system.

+ User Presses Show Robot Status Button:

   - The user presses the Show Robot Status Button.
   - The system prompts the user to enter a robot ID to check its status.
   - The system checks whether the robot ID is valid:
   - If the ID is valid, it shows the robotâ€™s status (whether it is Operational or Not Operational).
   - If the ID is invalid, the system will indicate that the robot ID is invalid.


+ User Presses Quit Button:

   - Finally, the user presses the Quit Button.
   - The system proceeds to end the simulation thread and close the GUI.

## Flow of the Diagram:
The diagram illustrates the flow of actions with parallel processes using fork and end fork constructs. Each action (pressing a button) creates its own flow, which can run along with other actions.
