I worked on the following during this sprint:
- Designed the architecture of the json file for the building input
- Integrated the nlohmann class with CPM so I could parse the json file
- Created a Building and Room struct that would hold information about the building
- Created a function to load the data from the json into a variable in sim
- Created a Catch testing code for the simulation
- Helped integrate MongoDB, wxWidgets, and the simulation all together when we were having problems
