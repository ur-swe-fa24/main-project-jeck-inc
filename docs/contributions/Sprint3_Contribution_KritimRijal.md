# Kritim

For **Sprint 3**, I worked on the following: 
- I integrated wxwidget into our system. 
- I created GUI to take necessary input (robot-id, info about robot)  and buttons to create a event sequence. 
- I implemented event buttons of the GUI in the System Manager . 
- I enabled viewing the logs of simulation which arrives as logs.txt inside build. 
- I created a system for the robot to have issue with certain probablity in each simulation time (implemented in Simulation) and created a fix button to fix the robot in GUI. 
- I also enabled viewing of all current robots in simulation and status of a particular robot through GUI and the simulation.
