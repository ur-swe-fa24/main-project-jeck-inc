I worked on the following during this sprint:
- Everything involving the Simulation:
    - Implemented assign_task to take a robot, validate it, and assign it to a room
    - implemented battery and fluid variables and functions in Robot
    - Implemented the actual simulation function: simulate() 
    - All logging components
    - Tested the simulation alone and with everything else working
