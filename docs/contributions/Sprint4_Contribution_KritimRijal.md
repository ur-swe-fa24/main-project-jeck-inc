For Sprint 4, I worked on the following:
- I organized the WxWidget within the code base and in the output of the program. 
    - Distributed GUI of each role to multiple components with Main being the home page
    - Connected all the GUIs with the common database and simulation instance
    - Setup the GUI for each of the four different roles
    - Also added functionalities in Building Manager and Building Staff
- I created a system to update database in every 30 seconds by getting information from Simulation and passing to Database through the System Manager. 
- Updated the complete User-Guide with images.
