I worked on the following things for Sprint0: 
- Product backlog for the role of Field Engineer.
- Added PBIs/Operational user stories to the Product Backlog.
- Created my own contributions statement.
- Wrote down and created the Planning document. 
- Assisted with the Customer Interview Document, adding notes in a few different sections.
    - Mostly added items in the "System Managment" portion.
