# Libraries
For this project, the library convention will be that each supporting library will live within its own subfolder.
For example, you might make `libsim` library, so you should have a sub-foler called `libsim` with your headers.
Header only libraries are fine.
To see the advantages and disadvantages, take a look at [this SO discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12671383/benefits-of-header-only-libraries).
